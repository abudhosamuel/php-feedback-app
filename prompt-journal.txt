BEGINNER’S TOOLKIT WITH GenAI – PROMPT JOURNAL
Project: PHP Feedback Web App
Student: [Your Name]
Date: [Start–End Dates]

------------------------------------------------------------
Purpose of This Journal
------------------------------------------------------------
This document records all the prompts I used with GenAI during my Moringa AI Capstone project. 
For each interaction, I captured:

- The exact prompt I used
- The curriculum reference
- A brief summary of the AI response
- What part of the response helped me
- My reflection on how AI supported my learning

This journal demonstrates my ability to:
- Explore a new technology using AI
- Apply AI guidance to build a working project
- Debug issues using AI assistance
- Evaluate AI output critically

------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT 1 – Choosing the Technology
------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
“I am doing the Moringa AI capstone: Beginner’s Toolkit with GenAI. 
Suggest a simple web technology (excluding Python, Java, JavaScript) for a mini project 
and explain why it is good for beginners.”

Curriculum Reference:
GenAI Module – Exploring new technologies with AI

AI Response Summary:
The AI suggested several technologies including PHP, Go, Kotlin and Dart.
It explained that PHP is widely used, easy to install, integrates well with HTML, 
and suitable for building small web applications.

Key Helpful Part:
The explanation about PHP running with a built-in development server helped me decide quickly.

Reflection:
This prompt helped me select PHP confidently and saved time researching options online. 
It showed me how AI can support decision making during the planning phase.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT 2 – Installing PHP
------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
“Give me a short, step-by-step guide to install PHP 8 on [my OS] and verify that it is working.”

Curriculum Reference:
GenAI Module – Environment Setup Support

AI Response Summary:
The AI provided installation steps and verification instructions using:
php -v

Key Helpful Part:
The verification step helped me confirm that my setup was correct.

Reflection:
This reduced confusion and saved time compared to searching blogs and YouTube.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT 3 – First PHP Script
------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
“Show me a minimal ‘Hello World’ example in PHP and explain what each line does.”

Curriculum Reference:
GenAI Module – Understanding Syntax with AI

AI Response Summary:
The AI explained PHP tags, echo, and how PHP executes on the server side.

Key Helpful Part:
Understanding where PHP code starts and ends within HTML.

Reflection:
I gained confidence writing my first PHP script and understanding server-side execution.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT 4 – Handling Form Data
------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
“Help me build a simple PHP web page with an HTML form (name and message) 
that submits via POST and displays the data back to the user.”

Curriculum Reference:
GenAI Module – Feature Implementation with AI

AI Response Summary:
The AI provided form handling logic using $_POST and basic validation.

Key Helpful Part:
Learning the pattern: check request method before reading POST data.

Reflection:
This helped me connect front-end forms to back-end PHP processing.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT 5 – Debugging Undefined Index Error
------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
“I am getting a PHP notice: ‘Undefined index: name’ when I submit the form. 
Explain why this happens and how to fix it.”

Curriculum Reference:
GenAI Module – Debugging with AI

AI Response Summary:
The AI explained that the error occurs when attempting to access POST values before submission
and suggested using:
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] === "POST") { ... }

Key Helpful Part:
Using null coalescing (??) and request method checks.

Reflection:
This helped me fix the error and understand a common PHP issue.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT 6 – Improving the UI
------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
“Suggest simple CSS to make my PHP feedback form look cleaner and centred on the page, 
without using any external frameworks.”

Curriculum Reference:
GenAI Module – UI Enhancement with AI

AI Response Summary:
The AI provided styling for typography, layout, and form elements.

Key Helpful Part:
Inline CSS examples that I could paste and adjust.

Reflection:
I learned how to improve visual presentation without complicating the project.

------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT 7 – Reflection Support
------------------------------------------------------------

Prompt:
“Summarise in one paragraph how GenAI helped me set up my PHP project, fix errors, 
and understand form handling, in simple English.”

Curriculum Reference:
GenAI Module – Reflection and Meta Learning

AI Response Summary:
The AI provided a structured summary covering learning, debugging, productivity,
and confidence improvement.

Key Helpful Part:
Clear structure for my final reflection section.

Reflection:
AI helped me reflect clearly and identify how it supported my learning process.

------------------------------------------------------------
AI LIMITATIONS NOTICED
------------------------------------------------------------

During this project, I observed several limitations when using GenAI:

- some responses were too general and required additional clarification
- some installation steps did not match my OS setup
- certain suggestions assumed different environments or tools
- I had to apply critical thinking to evaluate which instructions were correct
- AI sometimes provided outdated or missing commands

These limitations reminded me that AI cannot fully replace documentation, testing, 
or real hands-on troubleshooting. It is a helpful assistant, but human judgement 
was still required to successfully complete the project.

------------------------------------------------------------
OVERALL LEARNING REFLECTION
------------------------------------------------------------

GenAI acted as a learning assistant by:
- speeding up setup
- helping me debug errors
- providing explanations in simple language
- suggesting improvements to my code and UI

However:
- I still needed to test and run the code myself
- I had to evaluate which responses were useful
- Some steps required manual adjustments

Using GenAI improved my confidence and productivity, but I remained in control of the learning.
